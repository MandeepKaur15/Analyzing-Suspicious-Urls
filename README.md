# Analyzing-Suspicious-Urls

-The project aims at detecting fishing websites by doing the analysis of existing datasets containing suspicious URLs
using well-known Machine learning algorithms, Logistic Regression and Linear Support Vector Machine. 
This will mainly focus on extracting lexical and host-based features of URLs for determining their suspicious characteristics.
